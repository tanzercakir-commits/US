# PROGRESS — Append-only ledger

---

## (before this session) — Codex prototype — DONE
+ Isolated vertical slice: Clang JSON AST → Semantic IR → VC → deterministic
  affine checker; `cs:` contracts; result taxonomy; design document.
+ CodeSkeptic investigated read-only in a separate clone (findings in
  `docs/semantic_verification_prototype.md`); this repo is NOT CodeSkeptic.
Evidence: commits `4326583` (prototype, 25 files, ~4.2k lines) + `c6ddca5`
(docs); 64 unit tests.

## 2026-08-02 — Independent evaluation session — DONE
+ Core files audited line by line (checker/vc/model/contracts/frontend/
  pipeline); claims verified by execution.
+ Fail-closed behavior confirmed adversarially (`+=`, nested call, `while`,
  ternary, shadowing, `unsigned` → all correctly `unsupported`; disjoint-scope
  name reuse correctly accepted).
- Weaknesses recorded and routed into the plan: prover strength (→A1), call
  returns (→A2), loops (→A3), counterexample noise (→A4), Clang JSON bridge /
  single TU (→B1).
Evidence: `python -m unittest discover -s tests` → 64/64 (4.5 s);
`python -m semantic_verifier examples/vertical_slice.cpp` matches the design
doc (9 verified, 2 violated with real counterexamples, 1 honest unknown).
No code changes. Basis of decision D1 (take over).

## 2026-08-02 — Discussion sessions (vision + problem model) — NOTE
+ Thesis: not "a logic language AI understands" but "a logic layer that
  catches AI's mistakes".
+ Annotation value = enforcement class (ladder: docs → runtime → best-effort
  → proof).
+ Failure-layer model: context 35%, grounding 25%, goals 15%, intent 15%,
  capability 10%; solution list 1a–5c.
+ Bitter-lesson synthesis: the referee is a clean-training-data factory.
Outcome: PLAN.md §1 and the program map derive from these sessions.

## 2026-08-02 — F0.1: plan-system files — DONE
+ PLAN.md (programs A–F, ~90 stages, decision log D1–D11, constitution,
  rolling wave), PROGRESS.md, TODO.md, CLAUDE.md created.
+ Decisions: take over (D1), Python lab + C++ production + JSON schema bridge
  (D2), OOP discipline (D3), subprocess SMT (D4).
- Files were first authored in Turkish, then rewritten in English per the
  owner's language policy (D10) before the first commit.
Evidence: four files at repo root; baseline 64/64 green this session.

## 2026-08-02 — F0.2: guardrails — DONE
+ `.githooks/pre-commit`: full suite on every commit + test-count ratchet
  (`guardrails/test_baseline.txt` = 64) + PROGRESS.md required when code is
  staged.
+ `.githooks/commit-msg`: stage ID or allowed prefix required.
+ `.gitattributes` (LF for hooks), README workflow section,
  `core.hooksPath` activated locally.
- Z3 is NOT installed on this machine (`z3` not on PATH) — blocker for A1.2,
  not for A1.1. Install decision pending (GitHub release zip +
  `SEMANTIC_VERIFIER_Z3`, or a package manager).
- Hooks are per-clone: new clones must run
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once (documented in README/CLAUDE).
Evidence: hook scripts in `.githooks/`; activation verified by the F0.3
commit passing through them.

## 2026-08-02 — F0.3: first commit of the plan system — DONE
+ Plan system + guardrails committed on branch
  `feature/semantic-verification-prototype`.
Evidence: this commit (`F0: bootstrap plan system and guardrails`); pre-commit
hook ran the suite (64/64) during the commit.
Next: A1.1 (SMT-LIB2 emitter) — tomorrow's big start.

## 2026-08-02 — chore: TODO staleness guard + Z3 install — DONE
+ pre-commit extended: code commits now require TODO.md either staged or
  already carrying today's date (staleness guard). PROGRESS stays enforced
  per commit; TODO freshness enforced per working day.
+ Z3 5.0.0 (x64-win) installed user-scope at
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\z3-5.0.0-x64-win\bin\z3.exe;
  SEMANTIC_VERIFIER_Z3 User env var set. A1.2 blocker cleared.
- PATH deliberately untouched (setx truncation risk); discovery contract is
  the env var + known locations.
Evidence: `z3 --version` → "Z3 version 5.0.0 - 64 bit"; owner approved the
install in-session.
Next: A1.1 (SMT-LIB2 emitter).
